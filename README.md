# Titanic Survival Prediction
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on a variety of features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

# Project Overview
The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The goal of this project is to use data analysis and machine learning to predict which passengers were likely to survive the tragedy.

# Project Workflow
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  Analyzing the dataset to understand patterns and distributions.
  Visualizing key features to gain insights into survival factors.

Data Preprocessing
  Handling missing values.
  Encoding categorical features.
  Feature scaling and transformation.

Model Development
  Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms such as:
    Logistic Regression

Model Evaluation
  Using metrics like accuracy to evaluate model performance.

Prediction and Insights
  Generating predictions on test data.
  Identifying key factors influencing survival.
